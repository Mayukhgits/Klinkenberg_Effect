## Overview

The Klinkenberg effect describes the phenomenon where gas permeability appears higher than liquid permeability in porous media due to gas slippage at pore walls. This project provides tools to:

- Simulate gas flow with slippage effects
- Compare with liquid flow scenarios
- Visualize the permeability dependence on pressure

## Features

- Numerical simulation of gas slippage
- Visualization tools for permeability vs. pressure
- Comparison between Klinkenberg-corrected and uncorrected models
- Example datasets for common porous materials
