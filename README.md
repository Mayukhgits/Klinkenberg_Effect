# Klinkenberg_Effect

## Description

The Klinkenberg Effect, also known as gas slippage, describes the phenomenon where the permeability of a porous medium to gas is observed to be higher than its permeability to liquids or its absolute permeability measured under vacuum conditions. This effect is particularly significant in tight porous media (e.g., shale reservoirs, microfluidic devices) and at low pore pressures, where the mean free path of gas molecules becomes comparable to or larger than the pore size. Understanding and accounting for the Klinkenberg Effect is crucial for accurate modeling of gas flow in various applications, including:

* **Reservoir Engineering:** Predicting gas deliverability from tight gas reservoirs.
* **Geothermal Systems:** Analyzing gas transport in fractured rock.
* **Microfluidics:** Designing and optimizing micro-scale gas flow devices.

## Features

* Implementation of common Klinkenberg models (e.g., Klinkenberg's original equation, modifications).
* Tools for calculating apparent gas permeability from intrinsic permeability.
* Visualization scripts for understanding the impact of the Klinkenberg effect.
